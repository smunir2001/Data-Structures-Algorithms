# Data-Structures-Algorithms

### My personal DSAlgo repo. All code/analysis is my own algorithmic thinking and logic along with time/space complexity analyses.
* ### Be sure to check out all markdown (.md) files to learn about the specific data structure & algorithmic concepts.
* ### Checkout .java and .c files to view all source code regarding specific data structure & algorithm implementations.
* ### Also you're welcome to view .pdf files in each DS directory that consist of my hand-written notes and diagrams for an easier understanding/learning experience.

## C Programming
### Check this folder to view all data structure & algorithms implementation in C.
```C
printf("DSAlgo in C!\n");
```

## Java Programing
### Check this folder to view all data structure & algorithms implementation in Java.
```Java
System.out.println("DSAlgo in Java!");
```

## Searching Algo
### Check this folder to view all searching algorithms implementations (in Java).
```Java
Arrays.sort(array1);
array1.binarySearch(81);
```

## Sorting Algo
### Check this folder to view all sorting algorithms implementations (in Java).
```Java
array1.bubbleSort();
array2.insertionSort();
```
